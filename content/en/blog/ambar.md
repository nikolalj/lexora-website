When Nikola and Stefan Radojčić opened their first Ambar craft brewery and restaurant in Belgrade's Savamala district, they had ambitious plans. Their vision: bring craft beer culture to Serbia while serving modern interpretations of traditional Balkan cuisine. Five years later, they operate four bustling locations across Belgrade. The secret to their successful scaling? A POS system that grew with them.

## Starting Small, Dreaming Big

"From day one, we knew we wanted multiple locations," recalls Nikola, sitting in their flagship restaurant. "But our first POS system was built for a single restaurant. We didn't realize how much that would hold us back."

The original Savamala location was an instant hit. Within six months, they were turning away customers every weekend. The brothers knew it was time to expand, but their technology infrastructure wasn't ready.

"We had all our data locked in one physical server in the basement," Stefan explains. "To check sales from home, I had to remote desktop into that server. To understand inventory, I had to be physically in the restaurant. Managing one location was already complicated – scaling seemed impossible."

## The Expansion Nightmare

Despite the technological limitations, Ambar opened their second location in Dorćol in 2022. That's when the real problems began.

Each restaurant operated as an island:
- Separate POS systems with no connection between locations
- Inventory had to be managed individually at each site
- No way to transfer staff between locations without retraining
- Consolidated reporting required manual Excel gymnastics
- Pricing updates had to be done four times for every change
- Customer data was fragmented across systems

"I was spending entire Sundays just trying to understand our overall performance," Nikola remembers. "We'd have stock shortages at Dorćol while Savamala had excess. Staff who knew our systems perfectly at one location were lost at another. It was chaos."

The breaking point came during Serbian New Year 2023. Their Dorćol location's POS crashed during service, and they had no way to quickly deploy their IT person from Savamala. They lost an entire evening of revenue – their most profitable night of the year.

## Discovering the Cloud Advantage

A fellow restaurateur from Zagreb visited Belgrade and was amazed at how manually the Radojčić brothers were running their multi-site operation. "He showed us his Konty dashboard on his phone – managing three restaurants from a beach in Greece. We couldn't believe it was possible."

What captured their attention wasn't just the remote access, but the unified operations:
- Single dashboard for all locations
- Centralized menu and pricing management
- Real-time inventory visibility across sites
- Staff could work at any location with the same login
- Consolidated reporting happened automatically

"It wasn't just about better technology," Stefan emphasizes. "It was about finally having a system designed for multi-location restaurants like ours."

## The Migration Marathon

Switching four restaurants to a new POS system seemed daunting, but Konty's team had a strategic approach. They started with the newest, smallest location as a pilot, then rolled out to others based on lessons learned.

"The cloud architecture meant we didn't need any servers installed," Nikola notes. "Just tablets, terminals, and internet connection. The physical setup took hours instead of days."

The real magic was in the configuration. Konty created a master template with Ambar's menu, recipes, and workflows, then deployed it to all locations with site-specific modifications. Updates to the beer list or food menu could now be pushed to all restaurants instantly.

## Immediate Operational Improvements

Within the first month, the brothers noticed dramatic changes:

### Inventory Intelligence
"We discovered we were over-ordering craft beer ingredients by about thirty percent," Stefan reveals. "With visibility across all locations, we could balance inventory and reduce waste significantly."

### Staff Flexibility
During a food festival, Dorćol was understaffed while Savamala was quiet. "We moved three servers over, and they were taking orders within minutes. Same interface, same system, same login. It was seamless."

### Real-Time Decision Making
"I was at a supplier meeting when I got an alert that our Vračar location was having an unusually busy lunch," Nikola shares. "I could see exactly what was selling, approve overtime for staff, and even adjust kitchen priorities – all from my phone."

## Six Months Later: Transformation Complete

After half a year operating on Konty, Ambar's transformation was remarkable:

### Financial Performance
- **Reduced food costs** through better inventory management and waste tracking
- **Increased beverage sales** by identifying best sellers and optimizing stock levels
- **Improved labor efficiency** with better scheduling based on integrated data
- **Higher average checks** through data-driven menu engineering

### Operational Excellence
- **Centralized control** while maintaining site autonomy
- **Consistent customer experience** across all locations
- **Faster service** with improved order routing and kitchen display systems
- **Simplified training** allowing staff to work across locations

### Strategic Insights
- **Performance comparisons** revealed which locations excelled at different aspects
- **Customer patterns** showed how guests moved between their restaurants
- **Product mix analysis** helped optimize menus for each neighborhood
- **Real-time alerts** prevented problems before they impacted service

"The data insights alone justified the switch," Stefan explains. "We discovered our Vračar location sold twice as much wine as others due to the neighborhood demographic. We adjusted our inventory and wine list accordingly, and sales increased even more."

## Expanding with Confidence

The success with Konty gave the brothers confidence to accelerate expansion. They opened their fourth location in New Belgrade in 2024, and the launch was their smoothest yet.

"Setting up the POS took two hours," Nikola says with a smile. "We imported our configuration, trained staff in the morning, and were serving lunch. No IT disasters, no manual programming, no sleepless nights."

They're now planning their fifth location and considering expansion to Novi Sad. "With our old system, each new restaurant multiplied complexity exponentially. With Konty, it's just another location in the dashboard."

## The Competitive Edge

In Belgrade's competitive restaurant scene, Ambar's operational efficiency has become a significant advantage:

1. **Consistency**: Customers know they'll get the same experience at any location
2. **Innovation**: New menu items can be tested at one site and rolled out instantly if successful
3. **Agility**: They can respond to trends and feedback faster than single-location competitors
4. **Efficiency**: Lower operational costs allow for better pricing and higher quality ingredients
5. **Intelligence**: Data-driven decisions give them an edge in menu development and marketing

## Looking Forward

The brothers are now exploring Konty's advanced features:
- **Predictive analytics** to forecast demand and optimize purchasing
- **Loyalty program integration** to track customers across all locations
- **Kitchen automation** to further improve food preparation times
- **API connections** to their delivery partners for unified operations

"Konty didn't just solve our POS problems," Nikola reflects. "It transformed how we think about our business. We're not managing four restaurants anymore – we're managing one brand with four expressions."

## Advice for Growing Restaurant Groups

"If you're planning to expand, start with the right technology foundation," Stefan advises. "We wasted two years fighting with systems that weren't designed for growth. Every restaurant group we know that uses Konty wishes they'd switched sooner."

He particularly emphasizes the importance of cloud architecture: "Being able to manage everything from anywhere isn't just convenient – it's transformational. During COVID lockdowns, we could operate delivery from all locations while managing everything from home."
