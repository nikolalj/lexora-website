          "a2": "Yes! One of Lexora's unique features is cross-jurisdictional precedent mapping. You can see how courts in Montenegro, Serbia, and Croatia cite each other's decisions and identify common legal principles across borders.",
          "q3": "What if a case cites 50+ precedents?",
          "a3": "No problem. The system handles cases with hundreds of citations. You can filter by relevance score, jurisdiction, date range, or legal issue to focus on the most important precedents for your research.",
          "q4": "Can I export the precedent map?",
          "a4": "Absolutely. Export precedent maps as visual diagrams (PNG/PDF) or as structured lists with summaries of each case. Perfect for including in research memos or teaching materials."
